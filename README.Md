# Data and code for analysis of plague-associated deaths in British India from 1898â€”1949

This GitHub repository contains the code used to analyse the plague-associated death data in British India from 1898--1949. The pre-print for this analysis will be available in due course.

## Data

The data in this repository includes the plague-associated deaths and monthly temperature, rainfall and humidity data in each province of British India from 1898--1949. The data folder also contains all shape files (at the provincial administrative level) for British India during this time period. Information on how this data will be available in the preprint / main manuscript.

## Code

The code was written and executed in R. In order to run all plotting scripts, the data scripts must first be run. These data scripts produce new data files containing information on the timing of peaks in climate and plague-associated deaths. Plotting scripts then use these data files to perform the analysis will be available in the preprint / main manuscript.
